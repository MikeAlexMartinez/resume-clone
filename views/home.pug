            p Dear Future Employer
            p I'm a passionate problem-solver who loves to code and think about future. I enjoy solving new and novel challenges and am always seeking to learn new skills.
            p After my Philosophy and Psychology degree I fell into accountancy while working in the finance team at my first job. Accounting is what led to me first engaging with IT as I sought to automate our reporting and to find better ways to access and distribute more of the companies data.
            p Since engaging with IT I have found myself consistently wanting to delve deeper down the rabbit hole. I find the community engagement in open-source software developement and the ways strangers will support one another truly inspiring, and now I am seeking to start giving back to the communities I have learned so much from.
            p With little experience in working as a part a larger software development team, I am seeking to join an organisation where I can continue my journey into IT development, so that I can learn from those around me. My ideal employer will encourage their teams to write clear, testable, well-documented code, adhereing to industry best practices, and will also be supportive of my ambitions to give back to the open-source community.
            p By hiring me, you would be gaining someone who is determined to implement high quality, enduring solutions to any problems that you are faced with, and is completely commited to keep improving.
            p Yours faithfully,
